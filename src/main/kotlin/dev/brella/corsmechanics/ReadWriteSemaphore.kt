/**
 * A counting semaphore for coroutines that logically maintains a number of available permits.
 * Each [acquire] takes a single permit or suspends until it is available.
 * Each [release] adds a permit, potentially releasing a suspended acquirer.
 * Semaphore is fair and maintains a FIFO order of acquirers.
 *
 * Semaphores are mostly used to limit the number of coroutines that have an access to particular resource.
 * Semaphore with `permits = 1` is essentially a [Mutex].
